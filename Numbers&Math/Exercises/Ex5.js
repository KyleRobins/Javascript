// Exercise 5: Practical Scenario

// Imagine you have a rectangular field with a length of `20` meters and a width of `15` meters. Write JavaScript code to calculate and log the following:

// 1. The area of the rectangular field.
// 2. The perimeter of the rectangular field.

//Solutions

let length = 20;
let width = 15;

// 1. The area of the rectangular field.

// Area is calculated by multiplying length * width 

let area = length * width;
console.log("The Area of the Rectangle is:", area);


// 2. The perimeter of the rectangular field.

// Perimeter is calculated by adding the four sides of a rectangle

let perimeter = length * 2 + width * 2;
console.log("The Perimeter of the Rectangle is:", perimeter);
