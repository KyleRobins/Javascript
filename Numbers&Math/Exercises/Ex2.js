// Write JavaScript code to find the remainder of the following divisions using the modulus operator % and log the results:

// The remainder when 25 is divided by 7.
// The remainder when 144 is divided by 12.
// The remainder when 17 is divided by 4.


// 1. The remainder when 25 is divided by 7.

let remainder1 = 25 % 7;
console.log("The remainder when 25 is divided by 7 is:", remainder1);

//2. The remainder when 144 is divided by 12.

let remainder2 = 144 % 12;
console.log("The remainder when 144 is divided by 12 is:", remainder2);

//3. The remainder when 17 is divided by 4.

let remainder3 = 17 % 4;
console.log("The remainder when 17 is divided by 4 is:", remainder3);
