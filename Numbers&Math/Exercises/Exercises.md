### Exercise 3: Math Object Methods

Use the Math object methods to solve the following problems:

1. Generate a random decimal number between `0` (inclusive) and `1` (exclusive).
2. Calculate the square of `9`.
3. Find the square root of `64`.

### Exercise 4: Combining Operations

Write JavaScript code that combines multiple math operations to achieve the following:

1. Calculate the result of `(10 + 5) * 3`.
2. Find the average of `25`, `30`, and `35`.

### Exercise 5: Practical Scenario

Imagine you have a rectangular field with a length of `20` meters and a width of `15` meters. Write JavaScript code to calculate and log the following:

1. The area of the rectangular field.
2. The perimeter of the rectangular field.

### Challenge Exercise:

Solve the following problem using JavaScript:

A car is traveling at a constant speed of `60` kilometers per hour. Write JavaScript code to calculate and log the following:

1. The distance the car will travel in `3` hours.
2. The time it will take for the car to cover a distance of `180` kilometers.
