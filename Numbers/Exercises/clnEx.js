// Challenge Exercise:

// Solve the following problem using JavaScript:

// A car is traveling at a constant speed of `60` kilometers per hour. Write JavaScript code to calculate and log the following:

// 1. The distance the car will travel in `3` hours.
// 2. The time it will take for the car to cover a distance of `180` kilometers.


// Solution
let speed = 60;
let time = 3
// 1. The distance the car will travel in `3` hours.

// Distance = Speed * Time

let distance = speed * time;
console.log("Distance Covered in 3 hours:", distance, "Km");

// 2. The time it will take for the car to cover a distance of `180` kilometers.

// Time = Distance/speed

let distance2 = 180;
let time2 = distance2 / speed;
console.log("Time taken to cover 180 Km:", time2, "Hours");
