# JavaScript Comparison Operators

Comparison operators in JavaScript are essential for evaluating conditions and making decisions in your code. Let's explore both relational and equality operators along with examples:

## Relational Operators 🚀

### Greater Than (`>`)
The greater-than operator (`>`) checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

```javascript
console.log(10 > 5); // true
```

### Less Than (`<`)
The less-than operator (`<`) checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.

```javascript
console.log(10 < 5); // false
```

### Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)
The greater-than-or-equal-to operator (`>=`) checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

```javascript
console.log(10 >= 10); // true
```

### Less Than or Equal To (`<=`)
The less-than-or-equal-to operator (`<=`) checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

```javascript
console.log(10 <= 5); // false
```

## Equality Operators 🔍

### Strict Equality (`===`)
The strict equality operator (`===`) checks if both the value and the type of the left operand are equal to the right operand.

```javascript
console.log(10 === '10'); // false
```

### Strict Non-Equality (`!==`)
The strict non-equality operator (`!==`) checks if either the value or the type of the left operand is not equal to the right operand.

```javascript
console.log(10 !== '10'); // true
```

### Loose Equality (`==`)
The loose equality operator (`==`) checks if the value of the left operand is equal to the right operand, performing type coercion if needed.

```javascript
console.log(10 == '10'); // true
```

### Loose Non-Equality (`!=`)
The loose non-equality operator (`!=`) checks if the value of the left operand is not equal to the right operand, performing type coercion if needed.

```javascript
console.log(10 != '10'); // false
```

## Conclusion 🌟

Understanding and mastering these comparison operators is fundamental for building robust and expressive JavaScript code. Whether you're working with numerical values, strings, or other data types, these operators play a crucial role in implementing logical conditions in your programs. Explore and experiment with these operators to become proficient in handling various scenarios.
