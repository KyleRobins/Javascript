### 1. Concatenation

```javascript
let firstName = "Kyle ";
let secondName = "Robins";

let fullName = firstName.concat(secondName);
console.log(fullName); // Output: Kyle Robins
```

Concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings. In the example above, `concat` method is used to concatenate `firstName` and `secondName` into `fullName`.

---

### 2. Append

```javascript
firstName += " appended text";
console.log(firstName); // Output: Kyle appended text
```

Appending involves adding additional text to an existing string. Uncomment the provided lines to see how the `+=` operator can be used to append text to `firstName`.

---

### 3. Length

```javascript
console.log(firstName.length); // Output: 5
```

The `length` property returns the number of characters in a string. In this example, it prints the length of the `firstName` string.

---

### 4. Cases

```javascript
console.log(firstName.toLowerCase()); // Output: kyle 
console.log(firstName.toUpperCase()); // Output: KYLE
```

The `toLowerCase` and `toUpperCase` methods are used to convert a string to lowercase and uppercase, respectively.

---

### 5. Slice

```javascript
console.log(firstName.slice(0, 2)); // Output: Ky
```

The `slice` method extracts a portion of a string. In this case, it extracts characters from index 0 to 2 from `firstName`.

---

### 6. Split & Join

```javascript
console.log(firstName.split(" ").join(" ")); // Output: Kyle
```

The `split` method breaks a string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter, and `join` method combines array elements into a string. This example splits `firstName` based on space and then joins it back with a space.

---

### 7. Includes

```javascript
console.log(firstName.includes("y")); // Output: true
```

The `includes` method checks if a string contains a specific substring. It returns `true` if found, otherwise `false`. Here, it checks if `firstName` includes the letter "y".

---

### 8. Trim

```javascript
console.log(firstName.trim()); // Output: Kyle
```

The `trim` method removes whitespace from both ends of a string. This is useful for cleaning up user input.

---

### 9. Use of Backticks

```javascript
let backTicks = `Hello
there`;
console.log(backTicks); 
// Output: 
// Hello
// there

console.log(`${firstName} ${secondName}`); // Output: Kyle Robins
```

Using backticks allows you to create template literals, which support multiline strings and variable interpolation. In the example, `backTicks` contains a multiline string, and `${firstName} ${secondName}` demonstrates variable interpolation.
