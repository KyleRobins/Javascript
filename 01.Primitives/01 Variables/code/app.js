//How to declare variables
// (Reserved keyword): (variable name) = (type of value);

var name = "kyle"; // the var  keyword is the older syntax for declaring variables. It has function-scoping
let secondName = " Robins"; // the let keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned.
const whoami = "programmer"; // he const keyword is used to declare a variable with a constant value. It cannot be reassigned.

console.log(
    "My name is " +
     name +
      "" + 
      secondName +
       " whoami a " 
       + whoami);
