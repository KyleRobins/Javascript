## JavaScript Variables Notes ðŸš€

## Introduction

In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They are declared using the `let`, `const`, or `var` keyword. Here are the commonly used types of variables:

### 1. `let` Variable

- The `let` keyword is used to declare a variable that can be reassigned.

  ```javascript
  let age = 25;
  ```

### 2. `const` Variable

- The `const` keyword is used to declare a variable with a constant value. It cannot be reassigned.

  ```javascript
  const PI = 3.14;
  ```

### 3. `var` Variable (Older Syntax)

- The `var` keyword is the older syntax for declaring variables. It has function-scoping.

  ```javascript
  var count = 10;
  ```

## Naming Conventions

- Variable names should be meaningful, follow camelCase (start with a lowercase letter, capitalize subsequent words), and avoid reserved words.

  ```javascript
  let myVariable = "example";
  ```

## Data Types

JavaScript variables can hold various data types:

### 1. Strings

- Strings represent text and are enclosed in single or double quotes.

  ```javascript
  let greeting = "Hello, World!";
  ```

### 2. Numbers

- Numbers can be integers or floating-point values.

  ```javascript
  let age = 25;
  let price = 19.99;
  ```

### 3. Booleans

- Booleans represent true or false values.

  ```javascript
  let isStudent = true;
  ```

### 4. Arrays

- Arrays store collections of values.

  ```javascript
  let fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"];
  ```

### 5. Objects

- Objects store key-value pairs.

  ```javascript
  let person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
  ```

## Conclusion

Understanding variables is fundamental to working with JavaScript. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, mastering variables is essential for writing efficient and maintainable code.
