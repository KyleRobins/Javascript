 # Exercises on Basic string manipulations, including interpolation, coercion, and concatenation in JavaScript:

### Exercise 1: Basic Concatenation

Create a variable `firstName` with your first name and a variable `lastName` with your last name. Concatenate them to form a full name and store it in a variable called `fullName`. Log the result to the console.

### Exercise 2: String Interpolation

Use string interpolation to create a message that includes the `fullName` from the previous exercise. The message should be in the format: "Hello, [full name]! Welcome to JavaScript basics."

### Exercise 3: Numeric Coercion

Create a variable `age` with your age as a number. Convert it to a string and concatenate it with the following message: "I am [age] years old." Log the result to the console.

### Exercise 4: Escape Characters

Create a string that includes a newline character (`\n`) to print two lines of text. The first line should be "Hello," and the second line should be "World!"

### Exercise 5: Backticks vs. Single Quotes

Explore the difference between using backticks (\`) and single quotes (') for creating strings. Create a string using both methods and observe any advantages of using backticks, especially when dealing with multiline strings or string interpolation.

### Exercise 6: String Length

Find and log the length of the string "JavaScript Basics" without manually counting characters.

### Exercise 7: String Comparison

Create two strings, "apple" and "orange." Use string comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) to determine which string comes first alphabetically.

### Exercise 8: Substring

Given the string "JavaScript," extract and log only the "Script" part without modifying the original string.

### Exercise 9: String Conversion

Convert a numeric value (e.g., `42`) to a string and concatenate it with the string " is the answer to everything." Log the result.

### Exercise 10: Concatenation with Numbers

Create two variables, `num1` and `num2`, both containing numeric values. Concatenate them into a string and log the result.

These exercises cover fundamental string manipulations in JavaScript. Feel free to experiment with different scenarios and test your understanding of string operations.
